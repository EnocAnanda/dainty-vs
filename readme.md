## Setup

    git clone https://github.com/alexanderte/dainty-vs.git
    cd dainty-vs
    npm install

## CLI usage

Run `npm run build` to generate the color theme files. This produces `dist/dainty.vstheme` and `dist/dainty.vssettings`.

`configuration.json` is used for configuration, and the file is created with default values if it doesnâ€™t exist. The format of `configuration.json` is defined by [`configuration-schema.json`](https://github.com/alexanderte/dainty-vs/blob/master/configuration-schema.json).

## Configuration

Dainty can be configured by editing `configuration.json`. See [Configuration among applications](https://github.com/alexanderte/dainty-shared/blob/master/configuration-shared.md) for more details.

### Overriding usages of colors

Usages of environment colors and editor tokens can be overridden by adding the following object to the root of `configuration.json`:

```json
"replacements": {
  "overrides": {
    "searchReplace": {
      "#b5cea8": ["PURPLE_20", "PURPLE_20"]
    },
    "categories": {
      "ColorizedSignatureHelp colors": {
        "HTML Attribute Value": [[null, "BLUE_0"], [null, "BLUE_32"]]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each replacement is a tuple, where the first value represents the dark variation of the theme. The second value represents the light variation. For categories there is an inner tuple representing the background and text color, respectively.

## Server usage

Run `npm run start` to start Express server. These are the available routes:
