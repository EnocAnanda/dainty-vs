## Setup

    npm install

## CLI usage

Run `npm run build` to generate the color theme files. This produces `dist/dainty.vstheme` and `dist/dainty.vssettings`.

`configuration.json` is used for configuration, and the file is created with default values if it doesnâ€™t exist. The format of `configuration.json` is defined by [`configuration-schema.json`](https://github.com/alexanderte/dainty-vs/blob/master/configuration-schema.json).

## Server usage

Run `npm run start` to start Express server. These are the available routes:

| Method | Route                           | Description                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/`                             | Landing page                                                      |
| `GET`  | `/colors.html`                  | Colors page                                                       |
| `GET`  | `/coverage.html`                | Coverage page                                                     |
| `GET`  | `/dainty-css.html`              | Dainty.css page                                                   |
| `GET`  | `/syntax.html`                  | Syntax page                                                       |
| `GET`  | `/dainty-latest.zip`            | Generates the latest version of Dainty with default configuration |
| `POST` | `/dainty-latest-configured.zip` | Generates the latest version of Dainty with custom configuration  |

Custom configuration is sent as JSON using the request body, and the format is defined by [`configuration-schema.json`](https://github.com/alexanderte/dainty-vs/blob/master/configuration-schema.json).

## Overriding colors

Color scales can be overridden by adding the following object to `"colors"` in `configuration.json`:

```json
"overrides": {
  "blueGrays": "#11181b",
  "blues": "#ab47bc",
  "purples": "#42a5f5",
  "greens": "#84ffff",
  "oranges": "#82b1ff"
}
```

With a provided base color a scale of 40 shades is built. The color will be converted to LCh and its hue and chroma (saturation) will be kept.

Use `public/syntax.html` to quickly test new settings after running `npm run build`.
